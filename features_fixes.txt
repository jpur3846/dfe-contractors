Users:
- Admin

- Contractors (users)
--> Require their own signup form. This form automatically generates a contractor profile for them.

- Clients (client) (view the event they have booked)
--> Do not require their own signup form as this would be provided to them.

- Con Staff (con)
--> View events that are pertaining to them.

- Bookers (bookers)
--> Create, Update, Delete and Book in new events.
--> See upcoming events on dashboard.

Apps:
- Events (events)
--> Store the event model and connect to its various users.
--> EVERYTHING to do with an event is here. So worksheets (contractor), creating/editing an event(booker) is all done here.

To Do:
- Client Model
- If client tries to login to contractor portal redirect them somewhere.
- User forgotten password
- Make invoice and other aspects have all details.
- Pretty up views.
- Feedback form.
- Gig history
- Comment on events
- Complete event details -> calculate GST etc.
- Con-client app for their special view
- User updates need to propagate through the system.
- Standardise profile picture size
- Singer songlist
- Create a blacklist option.
- Create an administrator frontend for bookers.
- ManyToMany relationship between events and muses
- delete event button

NB/Other Issues to fix:
- Block get requests to worksheets (i.e. events/1) or wrong number/404.
- .gitignore setup to leave out files with possbile privacy issues i.e. sqlite DB and secret key.
- Users should not be able to be more that one of the attributes (i.e. Contractor, Booker, Client, Con Staff)
